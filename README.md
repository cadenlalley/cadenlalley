Hello! My name is Caden Lalley and I am a student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte pursuing my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. I am currently looking for a Software Engineering Internship as I am eager to put my knowledge and skills to work! Thanks for checking my GitHub out, hopefully you find one of my repositories interesting!
